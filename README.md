# Analogue 3D Images
These are the stock image labels sent to Analogue 3D reviewers.

## Installation

- Place the `labels.db` file in your Analogue 3D SD card in the following directory: `root/Library/N64/Images`
- Images should now appear on your cartridges as you insert them

## Updating the database

- If you'd like to modify or add images to this database, I recommend <a href="https://enoznal.com/3d/labels.html">this handy online tool</a>.
